/**
 * UIStateException is used to help us transition between UI States without closing the scanner or any of the previous
 * states completely. This will allow seamless transitions between the nested states of prelogin, postlogin, and game.
 * It allows me to throw an exception to be caught by the run method, bypassing any complicated return trees.
 * Theoretically this SHOULD work. It may be poor practice? It makes sense in my head.
